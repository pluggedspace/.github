# Pluggedspace

Pluggedspace builds enterprise intelligence infrastructure.

We design systems that transform raw, fragmented data into governed, production-grade decision engines.

Our core platform — **Akili’s Weave** — is an Enterprise Intelligence Platform engineered for high-performance analytics, multi-tenant governance, and operational AI deployment.

## Akili’s Weave

**Enterprise Intelligence Platform**

Akili’s Weave is a cognitive middleware layer between data and action.

It provides:

* Structured dataset lifecycle management (raw → refined → feature → trained)
* High-performance analytical execution powered by DuckDB
* Centrally governed model registry and inference pipelines
* Multi-tenant resource isolation and usage metering
* Compliance enforcement and audit logging
* Edge-optimized intelligence delivery

Akili is not a dashboard.
It is not a model wrapper.
It is infrastructure for decision systems.

## Architecture Principles

Akili is designed around:

* Local-first analytical performance
* Cloud-agnostic storage integration
* Deterministic dataset versioning
* Transparent lineage tracking
* Governed intelligence orchestration

The platform is built using:

* Django for control plane orchestration
* DuckDB for analytical execution
* Celery and Redis for distributed workloads
* Modular intelligence pipelines for scalable inference

---

## Strategic Direction

Pluggedspace is focused on building intelligence infrastructure optimized for:

* Complex data environments
* Emerging market realities
* Regulatory-aware systems
* Enterprise-grade governance

We are not building isolated AI tools.

We are building the substrate that powers them.

## Research & Experimental Systems

Exploratory projects and applied prototypes are developed under Pluggedspace Labs.

Labs exists to test vertical applications, modeling techniques, and applied automation systems.
Where strategically aligned, successful research may integrate into Akili’s infrastructure.

---

## Collaboration

Akili’s core infrastructure follows structured contribution standards.

Research collaborations and experimental contributions are managed through Labs repositories.

---

## Positioning

Pluggedspace is an intelligence infrastructure company.

Our focus is long-term system architecture — not short-term application features.
