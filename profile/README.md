## 🔬 What We Do

### Predictive Modeling

We design and deploy machine learning models that forecast outcomes across domains such as:

* **Sports Analytics:** Match prediction and performance insights.
* **Financial Signals:** Market movement and portfolio optimization.
* **Operational Intelligence:** Resource allocation, anomaly detection, and process automation.

### AI Infrastructure

We build modular APIs, data pipelines, and real-time inference systems using:

* **Python + Django REST Framework** for backend logic.
* **Scikit-learn / XGBoost / PyTorch** for model training.
* **Kong Gateway + Microservices** for secure and scalable delivery.

### Experimentation & Research

PluggedSpace Labs serves as our testbed for:

* New modeling techniques and architectures.
* Synthetic data generation and validation.
* Cross-domain knowledge transfer and automation tools.
